Title: Sales Prediction using Python

Description: This project is an implementation of a machine learning model to predict sales using historical sales data and other relevant factors using Python. The main objective of this project is to use machine learning algorithms to analyze historical sales data and identify the factors that contribute to sales, as well as to predict future sales based on these factors.

The project includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.

The repository includes the following files:

sales_prediction.ipynb: a Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation Advertising.csv: the historical sales data used for this project README.md: a detailed documentation of the project and its objectives
